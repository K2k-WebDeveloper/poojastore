              Also recognized as the festival of colors, Holi Dahan is among the
              popular festivals observed throughout India passionately. People
              light huge bonfires called Holika on the eve of Holi after singing
              and dancing around them. This joyous day for every Hindu sees
              friends and family members come together at parks or riversides,
              paving each otherâ€™s faces with dry or wet powders of varying
              colors using water pistols filled with painted water. For this
              reason, it is distinctive from other important traditional
              festivals such as Diwali and Ganesh Chaturthi whose happiness
              knows no limits around the world.
