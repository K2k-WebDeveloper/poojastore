              Maha Shivaratri is this sacred Hindu celebration which stands in
              honor of Lord Shiva and symbolizes lightâ€™s triumph over dark and
              ignorance. In such a spiritual context, fasting, praying and an
              all-night vigil help one reflect inwardly on oneself. This
              festival provides an opportunity for the heart to be cleansed to
              receive the divine grace of Lord Shiva through power from within
              and deepest knowledge.
